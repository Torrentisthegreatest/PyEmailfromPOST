# PyEmailfromPOST

Created to run a website so a form from another website can be summitted here so an email can be sent. Developed so a website hosted such that only html, css, and javascript work, not allowing for emails to be sent directly.

Set it up by changing the config.py file, only change the right fields in the dictionary.

Make sure to have your form action to "yourhost/submit" with the method POST.
